# Graphical Transformation Model

Graphical Transformation Models (GTMs) model multivariate data with intricate marginals and complex dependency structures non-parametrically, while maintaining interpretability through the identification of conditional independencies. GTMs offering two major advantages. Firstly, GTMs can capture complex nonlinear interdependencies as well as arbitrary marginals. Secondly, GTMs can be lasso regularized towards pairwise conditional independencies, akin to Gaussian graphical models.
